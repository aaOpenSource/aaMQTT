# aaMQTT
A small example of a bi-directional broker for MQTT to MXACCESS

##Proof of Concept
The current codeset is a working proof of concept showing how we can broker data between MQTT and Wonderware System Platform via the MXAccess protocol.  It is a complete example in the sense that it shows how you can both publish System Platform data to MQTT and subscribe to MQTT and write that data into Wonderware System platform.  What i have not done is create a complete example showing all options.  Nor have I spent any time performing any serious optimizations.  My intention is to plant a seed for others to take this work and push it even further. 

##Futures
At this point I don't have any major plans for feature adds in the future but if you would like to see something drop me a line and I'd be happy to look into it.
